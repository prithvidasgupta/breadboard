# Dev Notes

Thought about using PixiJS. Trying out SVG.js. Generate SVGs assets and then use them in PixiJS maybe...?

Currently using Lit component as a testbench

```
python -m http.server 8080
```


Feb 20 2025: Adding an SVG generator component for a breadboard. The size and colors can and should be parameterized.
