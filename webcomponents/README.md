# Dev Notes

Thought about using PixiJS. Trying out SVG.js. Generate SVGs assets and then use them in PixiJS maybe...?

Currently using Lit component as a testbench

```
python -m http.server 8080
```


Feb 19 2025: Adding an SVG generator component for a breadboard. The size and colors can and should be parameterized.

Feb 20 2025: Added origin to the breadboard so that I can move it around the screen. Origin coordinates should only be positive values.

Feb 22 2025: Added a Copliot generated code for a form with a Pixi App and a corresponding form as a LitElement
